# Symmetra Navigation System
# Web-based Navigation Application: WNAP

# System description I
A simple and highly usable system for navigation is needed. It has to allow
to navigate to the nearest store (e.g. Billa, Spar, Bipa), the next gas station
or the best hotel, using the optimal route. Where there are multiple ways
how the quality of the route can be defined: shortest, quickest, most
economical, cheapest, pleasant (e.g. quietest). In the future there should
be more options on what an optimal route looks like. The application has
to consider which means of transportation the person should use (e.g. car,
bike, foot), taking into account the current weather conditions. If a public
transport is selected it should indicate, which tram or bus line to take. The
application should allow in place purchase of tickets. The route should be
shown on a map to demonstrate how it looks like. The estimated travel
time should be displayed.

# System description II
If there are multiple about equally good routes, the user can choose which
one she wants to take. The system is a Web-based system and the users
should be able to operate the system by using a standard Web browser. The
users need not install any additional plug-ins to operate the system. In
particular, browser back button must be working at all times and it should
be possible to bookmark places at all times. Each page and each important
application state needs to have a unique and human-readable URL.

# System description III
The application should be intuitive to use and aesthetically pleasing, the
user should not wait longer than a few seconds for each request. The colour
scheme of the design can be selected by every user individually. The
language of the system can be freely chosen. When the user enters a new
trip, a list of popular places should help the user to quickly create routes. It
is expected that the application will be used by about 1,000,000 users and
about 1,000 users will concurrently search for routes.
